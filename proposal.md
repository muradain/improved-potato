# X-Team 40 Project Proposal

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

Briefly describe a problem that your team would like to solve.  
Describe at a high level a program that could solve that problem.

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Give your project proposal a name (and edit the top line of this file)
MegaSportStatTracker 3000000!


2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce.  Include and example format of the output produced.



3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.
Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.
Player statistics manually inputed or automatically pulled from web resources, including variables such as player name, number, team, and various statistics depending on the sport, such as stat types (meta) and things like goals scored or runs batted in.
Example input: sport: football; player first name: aaron; player last name: rodgers; number: 12; height inches: 74; etc.

4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.
We want to shy away from simple text menus. We could do simple search by player name or an advanced boolean style search to add aditional details like player team or player number or hometown etc.
After a search is performed, a list of players is displayed and the user can choose a player to display all of the relevant statistics. 


5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
