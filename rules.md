# X-Team 40 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
1) First come first serve.
2) If nobody volunteers, rock-paper-scisscors (2 out of 3)
3) Keep relatively equal workloads.
4) Ask for help if needed.


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
1) Frequent updates to our GroupMe
2) ASk each other how tasks are going
3) Let others know early if you can't get something done -> plan a group meeting


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Just be honest


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Talk about the project well before the deadline


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
